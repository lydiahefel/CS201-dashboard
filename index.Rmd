WOMEN ATHLETES IN THE OLYMPICS

The Olympic dataset used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results, it covers individual athletes - their id, name, sex, height, weight, represented country, sport, event, and medal placement. The dataset also includes the season, year, and location of each Olympic attendance. Hopefully, the data can be visualized in a few different ways that can answer the following questions about women in the Olympics. How has the participation of women athletes compared to men athletes in the Olympics? How do the height and weight of women athletes compare to that of men athletes? And, how does the proportion of medals won by women Olympians compare to those won by men Olympians?

Row One {data-width=1000}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comparison of the Height and Weight of Men and Women Olympians

```{r}
olympics_clean <- na.omit(olympics) %>%  # Remove rows with NA values
  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Filter out rows where either weight or height is NA
height_weight_plot <- ggplot(olympics_clean, aes(x = weight, y = height, color = sex, label = name)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_lydia +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("M" = "blue", "F" = "hotpink")) +
  labs(x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Height (cm)", color = "Gender")

ggplotly(height_weight_plot)
```

### Proportion of Medals Won by Men and Women Olympians

```{r}
medal_data <- olympics %>%
  filter(!is.na(sex) & !is.na(medal)) %>% 
  group_by(sex, medal) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(medal) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count) * 100)

medal_plot <- ggplot(medal_data, aes(x = medal, y = proportion, fill = sex)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_lydia +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("M" = "blue", "F" = "hotpink")) +
  labs(x = "Medal", y = "Proportion (%)", fill = "Gender")

ggplotly(medal_plot)
```

Row Two {data-width=1000} {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Participation of Men and Women Athletes at the Olympics 
```{r}
year_plot <- ggplot(olympics, aes(x = year, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~season) + 
  theme_lydia +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("hotpink", "blue")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Count", fill = "Gender")

ggplotly(year_plot)
```

### Proportion of Men and Women Athletes at the Olympics 
```{r}
proportion_data <- olympics %>%
  group_by(sex, year, season) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(year, season) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count) * 100)

proportion_plot <- ggplot(proportion_data, aes(x = year, y = proportion, color = sex, group = season)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Proportion (%)", color = "Gender") +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  theme_lydia +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("hotpink", "blue"))
